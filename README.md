# potential_flow
Visualization of elementary flow potential-lines, stream-lines, and velocities.
Superimpose sinks, sources, vortices, uniform flows, and doublets to visualize the resulting vector fields.

Controls:
To add an elementary flow, click the right mouse button.
To move an elementary flow, drag-and-drop using the left mouse button.
To add source flows, press 's' before clicking the right mouse button.
To add uniform flows, press 'u' before clicking the right mouse button.
To add vortex flows, press 'v' before clicking the right mouse button.
To add doublet flows, press 'd' before clicking the right mouse button.
To delete a flow, select the origin point and press 'delete'.
To switch between visualizations (velocity, streamlines, and potentials), hit the 'space' button.
To change the image quality, press the up/down arrow keys.
To clear the entire scene, press 'c'.
To show/hide the flow origin points, press 'o'.
